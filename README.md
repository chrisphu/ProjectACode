# "Project A" Code

"Project A" is a game being privately developed by me using the [Godot Engine (.NET)](https://godotengine.org).

While most of the assets for "Project A" are considered commercial and therefore are not shared, I am choosing to share the code I write for the game in this GitHub repo as a learning resource and for general interest. This decision is inspired by the [Celeste developers](https://github.com/NoelFB/Celeste).
